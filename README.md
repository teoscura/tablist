# tablist
A simple Beta 1.7.3 Plugin built on Poseidon to list Online and Offline players.

/tab
 to list all online players

/lastonline
 to list all offline players, and how long since they were online for the last time

 The latter will list all players in lowercaps due to it relying on the whitelist to get all the offline players to list.

 Built with IntelliJ IDEA, using the Project Poseidon Jar as a Library.
